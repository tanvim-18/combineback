            Sending passenger data to the server to get a prediction fits the semantics of a POST request.
            
            POST requests send data in the body of the request...
            1. which can handle much larger amounts of data and data types, than URL parameters
            2. using an HTTPS request, the data is encrypted, making it more secure
            3. a JSON formated body is easy to read and write between JavaScript and Python, great for Postman testing
